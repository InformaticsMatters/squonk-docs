## CATEGORY
Molecular Properties

## SOURCE
ChemAxon

## DESCRIPTION
Astex rule of 3 filter for filtering fragment libraries implemented with ChemAxon

## INPUTS
A dataset of molecules

## OUTPUTS
A dataset of molecules

## OPTIONS

**Filter mode:** `INCLUDE_ALL`, `INCLUDE_PASS`, `INCLUDE_FAIL`<br>
**Number of violations:** the number of filters that are allowed to fail.<br>
**Property filters** for Molecular weight, LogP, h-bond donors, h-bond acceptors and rotatable bonds can be specified as min and/or max values. Defaults are as specified in the original paper. Leave empty if no constraint is to be applied.

## ADDITIONAL INFO

The rule of 3 filter was devised by Astex for fragment libraries as an equivalent to the Lipinski rule of 5 filter for drug like libraries, and is described in <cite>Congreve et al., [Drug Discov. Today. 8 (19): 876â€“7, (2003)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644603028319)</cite>.

The default parameters used here are:

- Molecular weight <= 300
- LogP <= 3
- H-bond donor <= 3
- H-bond acceptor count <= 3
- Rotatable bond count <= 3
