<!-- TODO: Should the title be this instead? 'Terms and Conditions for using the Squonk Site' the xwiki has to titles. -->

## Terms of Use

We provide users access to the Squonk site to allow evaluation of the Squonk Computational Notebook and related services.

We make all reasonable efforts to ensure this is done in a safe and secure manner so that data will not be visible to other users unless you specifically choose to share it.
However we cannot provide absolute guarantees and do not bear any responsibility in cases where your data is lost or seen by other parties. You must assess the confidentiality and importance of any data that you load into Squonk.

The site is made available for evaluation purposes. It does not have capacity to support widespread use of computationally demanding workflows. Please use it accordingly.

## Information about you

You are registered as a user of Squonk at your request.
We keep a small amount of information about you to allow us to operate Squonk in a secure manner and to be able to communicate with you on matters relating to Squonk, such as news, new features and updates.
The information we store is limited to your name and email address.

We do not share this information with any other parties.

If you no longer wish us to store this information then you should contact us at info@informaticsmatters.com and we will delete your user account.
Once this is done you will not be able to access the Squonk site.
